Project describtion (Abstract):
The growing number of satellites and space debris significantly elevates the risk of collisions, threatening the sustainability of space missions. 
Autonomous satellites must rely on highly accurate state propagation algorithms to navigate and avoid potential collisions. 
This project evaluates the performance of six state propagation algorithms for predicting satellite positions: Runge-Kutta methods (RK4, RK8), Dormand-Prince (ODE45), Vernerâ€™s Method (ODE78), 
Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (ODE113), and Modified Picard-Chebyshev Iteration (MPCI). 
The algorithms were tested using real-world satellite data in a simulated environment to compare accuracy, computational efficiency, and execution time against the Standard General Perturbation (SGP4) model. 
The results offer insights into the trade-offs between precision and computational cost, guiding the selection of the optimal algorithm for use in autonomous satellite navigation systems.
